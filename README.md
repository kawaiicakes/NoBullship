## This mod is currently in beta and under active development! Please back up your worlds prior to and routinely following installation!

</div>

Are you a **modpack dev** who finds crafting planes, ships, cars and other such entities inside crafting tables boring?
Enough with that bullship, **this mod is for you!**

**_No Bullship_** is a mod that lets you craft these entities using a multiblock structure which **you** can define! Pretty much any block you can think of can be used, and may **include blockstates and NBT data!**
The entities you can make aren't restricted either; make any entity, including any NBT data! In the future, this mod will also allow you to disable drops - even hardcoded ones - for entities.
This will allow modpackers to more easily prevent obtaining entities in their inventories! [Learn more about how to make a **_No Bullship!_** data file here.](https://github.com/kawaiicakes/NoBullship/wiki)

This mod is intended for modpackers to use & configure; however, it will come with recipes for some mods in the near future.

![Schematic for a boat](2023-12-07_21.02.38.png)
2. Use the Workshop to display the recipe into the world!
![Schematic preview in world](2023-12-07_21.03.35.png)
3. Build stuff just like you would for an Iron Golem (Note: sideways and upside-down building will not work)

4. Right-click the multiblock with the schematic!

# üíª For Developers

Internationalization and misc PRs are welcomed!

## Modders
To add this mod as a dependency, using Curse Maven would probably the simplest route.
As a mod dev, you will probably be looking in the .api package for most of the things you'll need, and I've included some
documentation here and there. I'll get on improving it as I clean the API. [Further reading on the wiki.](https://github.com/kawaiicakes/NoBullship/wiki)

## Modpack Devs
Detailed info on creating datapacks for this mod may be found [here.](https://github.com/kawaiicakes/NoBullship/wiki) Otherwise, feel free to include this mod in your modpack! It was made specifically for modpackers!
Anyhow, don't expect the structure of data files for this mod to change. I will work hard to maintain them as they are now if possible and the format isn't difficult to work with; continued development of this mod notwithstanding.

Credit to **blackbirdantlion** on Discord for the lovely GUI texture. I've modified it a bit as I am reusing it from another project I am working on, which I have permission to do. You may find his Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/BlackbirdieAnt).
