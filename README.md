## This mod is currently in alpha and under active development! Please back up your worlds prior to and routinely following installation!

</div>

Are you a **modpack dev** who finds crafting planes, ships, cars and other such entities inside crafting tables boring?
Enough with that bullship, **this mod is for you!**

**_No Bullship_** is a mod that lets you craft these entities using a multiblock structure which **you** can define! Pretty much any block you can think of can be used, and may **include blockstates and NBT data!**
The entities you can make aren't restricted either; make any entity, including any NBT data! In the future, this mod will also allow you to disable drops - even hardcoded ones - for entities.
This will allow modpackers to more easily prevent obtaining entities in their inventories!

This mod is intended for modpackers to use & configure; however, it does come with recipes for some mods. See below.

---

# üìñ Information

## Quick How-To
- Craft a schematic for the multiblock recipe you wish to make! 
- Use the Workshop to display the recipe into the world!
- Build stuff just like you would for an Iron Golem, then right-click with the schematic! (Note: sideways and upside-down building will not work)

## Features
- Straight-forward datapack creation for multiblock & schematic recipes
- Multiblocks may require extra items in the inventory to make!
- Supports NBT and blockstate data for both crafted entities and ingredient blocks!
- Packaged support for select mods! Read below!
- Lots of config options!

The models and textures were made by me.

Credit to **blackbirdantlion** on Discord for the lovely GUI texture. I've modified it a bit as I am reusing it from another project I am working on, which I have permission to do. You may find his Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/BlackbirdieAnt).

I also want to thank [embeddedt](https://github.com/embeddedt), his Discord community members and [1whohears](https://github.com/1whohears) for miscellaneous advising.

Also, I want to commend Kaupenjoe for his free Forge tutorials on YouTube to brief me on how some things work lol
